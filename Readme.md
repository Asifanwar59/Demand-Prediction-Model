# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Pattern
The deep learning model predicts daily bike rental ridership. It demonstrates a neural network model including forward pass, backpropagationa and sigmoid activation function. 

# Key points of the model:
1. All the code in the notebook runs in Python 3.
2. Model includes unit tests to test each stage of the model.
3. GPU is not required to run this model.
4. The html file contains code along with the sample output generated on executing the code. i.e., bikeSharing.ipynb exported in html format.
5. answer.ipynb contains methods called from bikeSharing.ipynb file.

# Model Specifications
1. The model generates at training loss below 0.09 and the validation loss below 0.18.

# Data Set

Bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to the environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions,
precipitation, day of week, season, hour of the day, etc. can affect the rental behaviors. The core data set is related to  
the two-year historical log corresponding to years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA which is 
publicly available in http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data. We aggregated the data on two hourly and daily basis and then 
extracted and added the corresponding weather and seasonal information. Weather information are extracted from http://www.freemeteo.com. 

# Associated tasks
	- Regression: 
		Predication of bike rental count hourly or daily based on the environmental and seasonal settings.
	
	- Event and Anomaly Detection:  
		Count of rented bikes are also correlated to some events in the town which easily are traceable via search engines.
		For instance, query like "2012-10-30 washington d.c." in Google returns related results to Hurricane Sandy. Some of the important events are 
		identified in [1]. Therefore the data can be used for validation of anomaly or event detection algorithms as well.

# Files
	- Readme.txt
	- hour.csv : bike sharing counts aggregated on hourly basis. Records: 17379 hours
	- day.csv - bike sharing counts aggregated on daily basis. Records: 731 days

	
# Dataset characteristics

Both hour.csv and day.csv have the following fields, except hr which is not available in day.csv

	- instant: record index
	- dteday : date
	- season : season (1:springer, 2:summer, 3:fall, 4:winter)
	- yr : year (0: 2011, 1:2012)
	- mnth : month ( 1 to 12)
	- hr : hour (0 to 23)
	- holiday : weather day is holiday or not (extracted from http://dchr.dc.gov/page/holiday-schedule)
	- weekday : day of the week
	- workingday : if day is neither weekend nor holiday is 1, otherwise is 0.
